# FCP 100: Adding armv7 MACHINE_ARCH

A new MACHINE_ARCH for the armv7 machines is needed. While one can
support armv6 and armv7 in one architecture, it creates a lot of
unnecessary friction.

While it initially felt like similar to the difference between i486
and i586, the number of changes required to make this happen are
larger, especially in ports. Linux has agressively adopted armv7 for
it's configuration, so having our uname -p match Linux will make the
ports easier to adopt.

## Changes to the system

### Build Changes

* Change the build infrastructure to accept armv7 as a valid target.
* Change the build infrastructure to generate code optimized for armv7 target.
* Change the build infrastructure to have the same speical cases for armv7 that we have for armv6.

### Kernel Changes
* Have all the kernels, except RPI-B, use armv7 as the target arch, so uname -p returns the right name.
* Rename RPI-B to GENERICv6 since it is the only
* armv7 and armv6 binaries look pretty close to the same, so we'll need some way to not run armv7 binaries on an armv6 kernels.

### Ports Changes
* All ports that have tried to shoe-horn in the current infrasture need to be examined and likely modified.
* Ports exp run will need to be run for both armv6 and the new armv7
* Package infrastructure will need to grow armv7 support

### Handbook Changes
* Need to change

### Man page Changes
* TBD

### RE Changes
* We'll need to migrate the armv6 stuff to armv7.
* Add new arch. Normally this is a hassle, but it's movement in this case, not additions.

## Impacts

### Interfaces

Currently, many things are based on the machine processor being amrv6. Those would need to be audited and change. There will be customer visitible downstream changes needed.

### Upgrade

We'll need some way to support upgrades on either side the integration into the tree.

### Packages

We'll need some way to upgrade armv6 packages to armv7.
